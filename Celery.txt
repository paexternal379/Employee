### What is Django Celery?

Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue used to execute tasks in the background. When integrated with **Django**, it allows you to:

- Run time-consuming operations outside the main request-response cycle.
- Schedule periodic tasks (like cron jobs).
- Handle distributed workloads using message brokers.


### How Django Works with Celery

1. Django defines the task (e.g., sending an email, generating a report).
2. Celery processes the task in the background using a **worker**.
3. A message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis) sends the task from Django to Celery.

### Key Components

 - Tasks: Python functions decorated with `@shared_task` or `@app.task`.
 - Worker: A background process that listens for tasks and executes them.
 - Broker: ddleware (usually Redis) that queues tasks between Django and Celery.
 - Beat (optional): A scheduler for running periodic tasks.

### Example Setup**

1. **Install Celery**:

   ```bash
   pip install celery redis
   ```

2. **In your Django project folder**, create a `celery.py` file:

   ```python
   # myproject/celery.py
   import os
   from celery import Celery

   os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')

   app = Celery('myproject')
   app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
   app.autodiscover_tasks()
   ```

3. **In `__init__.py` of your project**:

   ```python
   from .celery import app as celery_app
   __all__ = ('celery_app',)
   ```

4. **Create a task** in an app:

   ```python
   # myapp/tasks.py
   from celery import shared_task

   @shared_task
   def send_welcome_email(user_id):
       # send email logic
       return f"Email sent to user {user_id}"
   ```

5. **Run the worker**:

   ```bash
   celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info
   ```
